Abstract
--------

This study investigates experimentally manipulated arousal influence
on post decision consolidation processes within the theoretical
framework of the differentiation and consolidation theory of human
decision making \parencite{svensson92b}.  Fifty-six university
students participated in the experiment.  Instructional manipulation
of participants' level of arousal was used. A multi-attribute decision
task concerning a choice between two apartments was used.  One week
later the participants had to recall the task.  Heart rates were
measured using a heart rate meter, and current mood assessed using a
questionnaire \parencite{LewinsohnMano93}.  Results of the arousal
manipulation were not found, nor any consolidation effect (F-test,
$\alpha$=.05).  No importance reversals of alternative attributes
occurred.  Interaction effects between commitment, activation level,
level of arousal, conflict and ability to recall variables were not
found (Tukey's HSD, $\alpha$=.05).  The conclusion was that
predictions failed due to too weak a manipulation of arousal.
Implications for future research were discussed.}
